Wait, let me reconsider this. The file changes only show TypeScript/React files being modified (`app/tryout/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/tryout/layout.tsx`), which are source code files. There are no build artifacts, dependencies, or temp files in the changes. Following rule #6, since the changes contain only source files and no build artifacts, dependencies, or temp files, the output should be empty.
